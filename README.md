This project was made in Python:
Using Pycharm
Installing  Selenium extension
Installing Behave extension
Installing Selenium WD y project folder
Installing Gherin Plugin in Pycharm

I also have used some Python and Selenium libraries.

I have not used POM since I am not very familiar with them using Behave+Gherkin

To run the projects, user must run in the Terminal, the following:

behave features\addUser.feature
behave features\deleteUser.feature
